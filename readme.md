# ROS tutorial
## What is ROS? Why should I use it?
ROS stands for Robot Operating System. ROS is used in industry because it has a number of advantages:
- It's modular. A robot's different sensing, control and actuation systems can be developed separately, managing complexity. 
- Modularity means robot parts can be written in different languages like python and C working together, so you can have the advantages of each.
- There are plenty of existing ROS modules out there, which can be reused.

## Tutorial requirements
To comfortably understand this tutorial, you need to know your way around a command line. At the very least, you should know how to use the `cd` command. 

Optional extras that will help you speed through / fix problems are:
- A working knowledge of `docker` if you are using docker, or your shell if you are using linux
- Good python skills.
- A solid internet connection to download stuff over.

If you are running Linux, you can still use our docker setup; or you can install ros using instructions available on google. 

## More resources
ROS has a few more tricks up its sleeve, including **services**, **image handling**, **a whole stack of libraries**, **rosparam**, and even **operating across physical machines**. These can be very powerful features, and the first step to discover them is to check out the real ROS tutorials at the official website: https://wiki.ros.org. Happy coding!
